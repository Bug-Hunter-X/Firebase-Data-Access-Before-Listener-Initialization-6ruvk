To fix this, ensure the data access happens *after* the listener has finished setting up.  This usually means accessing data within the `onValue` callback but after the data has loaded and is ready.  Using asynchronous functions like Promises or async/await can help manage the order of operations.

Here's an example of the corrected code using async/await:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const dbRef = ref(db, 'path/to/data');
  onValue(dbRef, (snapshot) => {
    const data = snapshot.val();
    if (data) {
      // Access and process data here
      console.log('Data:', data);
    } else {
      console.log('Data not available yet.');
    }
  });
}
```

Remember to handle the possibility of data not being available yet. Always use proper error handling and checks to ensure your app behaves gracefully.
